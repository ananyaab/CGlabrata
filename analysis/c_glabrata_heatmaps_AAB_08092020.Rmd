##IMPORANT CODE FOR LATER PROJECTS (sets rownames of normalized_counts as the values in the gene column of orig_normalized_counts)
rownames(normalized_counts) <- orig_normalized_counts$gene

##heatmap
heatmap(as.matrix(normalized_counts), Colv = NA, Rowv = NA)

##this heatmap has data of ~5000 genes, and not all of them are related to pho4. 
##In order to make sense of the data, the data should be subset to only show pho4-related genes

##only pho4 genes dataset
CglabPHO4WT<-C_glabrataGRP_Phosphate_Genes_7302020
rm(C_glabrataGRP_Phosphate_Genes_7302020)

##formatting and subsetting this new dataset
reduced_normalized_counts<-CglabPHO4WT[myvars]
rownames(reduced_normalized_counts) <- CglabPHO4WT$gene

##heatmap
heatmap(as.matrix(reduced_normalized_counts), Colv = NA, Rowv = NA)

##this is a weird heatmap, and I can't really see any correlations... need to ask about this
